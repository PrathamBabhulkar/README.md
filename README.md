I am a self-taught Full-stack web/mobile developer from India.

I enjoy taking up complex problems and turning them into simple and beautiful interface designs.

I also love the logic and structure of coding and always strive to write elegant and efficient code, whether it be HTML, CSS, or Bootstrap.
